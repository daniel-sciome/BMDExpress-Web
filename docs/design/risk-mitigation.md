# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Native library integration issues** | Medium | High | Early prototype in Phase 6; Docker isolation; fallback to REST API for ToxicR |
| **Performance degradation** | Medium | High | Early performance testing; profiling; caching; horizontal scaling |
| **Data migration issues** | Medium | Medium | Extensive testing with real .bm2 files; validation scripts; rollback plan |
| **UI complexity** | Low | Medium | Iterative UI development; user feedback; simplified initial release |
| **Database scalability** | Low | High | Proper indexing; read replicas; partitioning strategy; object storage for large data |

## Schedule Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Underestimated development time** | High | Medium | Buffer time in schedule; prioritize MVP features; agile sprints |
| **Dependency on external libraries** | Low | High | Early validation of key dependencies; vendor evaluation |
| **Testing bottlenecks** | Medium | Medium | Automated testing; continuous integration; parallel testing |

## Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Production deployment issues** | Medium | High | Staging environment; blue-green deployment; rollback automation |
| **Security vulnerabilities** | Medium | High | Security audit; dependency scanning; penetration testing |
| **User adoption challenges** | Medium | Medium | User training; documentation; support channels; phased rollout |

## Contingency Plans

**If native libraries fail to integrate:**
- Option 1: Use REST APIs to external services
- Option 2: Provide desktop CLI as alternative
- Option 3: Partner with cloud providers for hosted solutions

**If performance targets not met:**
- Implement aggressive caching
- Add more worker nodes
- Optimize database queries
- Consider batch processing only

**If schedule slips:**
- Release MVP with core features only
- Defer advanced visualizations
- Focus on API first, UI second
