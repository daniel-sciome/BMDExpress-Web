# BMDExpress-Web Documentation

Welcome to the **BMDExpress-Web** project documentation.

## Overview

BMDExpress-Web is a Spring Boot/Vaadin web application that ports the BMDExpress-3 desktop application to a multi-user, cloud-ready platform. The application enables researchers to analyze high-dimensional dose-response data (particularly gene expression data) using EPA BMDS software and ToxicR models to calculate benchmark dose (BMD) values.

## Key Features

- **Multi-user access**: Enable collaborative research across institutions
- **Cloud deployment**: Scalable infrastructure for computationally intensive analyses
- **Modern web UI**: Accessible from any browser without desktop installation
- **API-first design**: Support programmatic access and integrations
- **Maintain scientific integrity**: Preserve validated algorithms from desktop version
